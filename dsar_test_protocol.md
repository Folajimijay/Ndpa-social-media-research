# DSAR Test Protocol (NDPA Focus)
**Date:** 21 August 2025

## Platforms (suggested set)
Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), YouTube, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Threads (select 6–8).

## Preparation
- Create study‑specific accounts per platform. Use a research email alias. Avoid submitting real sensitive content.  
- Enable 2FA where possible.  
- Document baseline privacy settings (screenshots).

## Requests to Submit
1. **Access Request** — request a copy of personal data and categories processed.  
2. **Erasure Request** — request deletion of personal data (account and associated metadata, where feasible).

## Evidence to Capture
- Request ID/URL, timestamp submitted, acknowledgement timestamp.  
- Identity verification requested (Y/N; type).  
- Response timestamp(s); files received (type/format e.g., JSON/CSV/HTML/PDF); completeness notes.  
- Outcome: Fulfilled / Partially fulfilled / Refused (with reason).  
- Guidance provided (appeal/complaint channel; DPO contact).

## KPIs
- **T_ack:** Time to acknowledgement (hours).  
- **T_resp:** Time to substantive response (days).  
- **Completeness Score (0–5):** Data categories + metadata; portability; machine‑readable format; explanations.  
- **Usability Score (0–5):** Ease of finding DSAR page; number of steps; clarity of instructions.

## Logging
Use **data/templates/dsar_log_template.csv** to record each request and outcome. Store redacted artifacts in a private folder; do not commit raw exports to the public repo.

## Ethics & Compliance
- Use only official, publicly provided DSAR channels.  
- No circumvention, automation against terms, or false identity documents.  
- Redact identifiers before publication.
